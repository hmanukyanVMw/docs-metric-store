## <a id='v1.5.1'></a> v1.5.1

**Release Date:** November 18, 2020

* Replication factor defaulted to 2.
  * This will double previous storage requirements, as metrics going forward will be replicated across nodes.
  * Metrics stored prior to this upgrade will continue to exist, but only on a single node. This will result in inconsistent query results for non-replicated metrics, depending on which node gets queried.
* Include and use route registration health check.
* The `replication factor` is configurable from OpsManager
* The `max concurrent queries` is configurable from OpsManager
* Updated tile internal certs to include missing SANs. *These certs are regenerated automatically*

**Release Date:** September 29, 2020

* Fixed bug where Metric Store was intermittently dropping points between nodes
* Added instance_id label to http_* metrics
* Removed empty errand `metric-store-smoke-tests`

## <a id='v1.4.3'></a> v1.4.3

**Release Date:** August 17, 2020

* This release fixes a memory leak that would cause the Metric Store to slowly run out of memory due to not cleaning up closed network connection go routines.

### <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

This release has a bug in the `http_total` metric when the Metric Store is running on multiple nodes. Metric Store incorrectly tracks a label `node_index` value as 0 as opposed to the true node index. Resolved release 1.4.2.


## <a id='v1.4.0'></a> v1.4.0

**Release Date:** March 31, 2020

* Replication is now Availability Zone aware. **Note** for those upgrading from Beta versions this will cause a loss in metrics.
* Updated our CA properties to help customers rotate both their Ops Manager and CredHub stored certificates.
* Updated read sample limit to 20,000,000, previously set to 1,000,000.
* Removed PromScraper to inject Metric Store metrics into Firehose.
  * Scraping Metric Store Prometheus endpoint via mTLS.
